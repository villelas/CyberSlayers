## 💡 Context & Motivation  
In today’s data-driven world, information is more valuable—and more vulnerable—than ever. As companies leverage AI and data analytics, personal information can be exploited in ways users don’t even realize (e.g., airlines adjusting prices based on ZIP code).  

Children and teens, aged **8–16**, are particularly at risk due to limited life experience and a lack of cybersecurity education targeted toward their age group. Typical online safety materials are too complex or inaccessible.  

**CyberSlayers** aims to change that by:  
- Making cybersecurity *fun* and *approachable* through interactive games and missions.  
- Helping children of non-technical parents learn critical digital safety skills.  
- Reducing ignorance-based vulnerabilities in the next generation.

## 🧩 Specific Problems Addressed  
- Lack of cybersecurity education for younger audiences  
- Increased risk of data misuse and breaches  
- Limited awareness among children and parents about online safety  
- Overly technical cybersecurity resources not tailored for kids
